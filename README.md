📘 Day 5 Task – Detecting Mixed Data Types in Pandas
🧑‍💻 Author

Sainath Reddy

📌 Project Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (new_file.ipynb) that demonstrates how to identify and handle mixed data types when working with data in Pandas using Python. The notebook likely explores inspecting, detecting, and cleaning mixed-type columns to improve data quality before analysis.

In data analysis, some columns may contain different kinds of values (e.g., numbers and strings in the same column), which makes processing more difficult. This notebook shows how to find these mixed types and convert them into consistent formats.
